# Question 1

## Question
(Target-Heart-Rate Calculator) While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) (http://bit.ly/AHATargetHeartRates), the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years. Your target heart rate is a range that’s 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified health-care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.]
Create a class called HeartRates. The class attributes 142 Chapter 3 Introduction to Classes, Objects, Member Functions and Strings should include the person’s first name, last name and date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for the month, day and year of birth). Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters. For each attribute provide set and get functions. The class also should include a member function that calculates and returns the person’s age (in years), a member function that calculates and returns the person’s maximum heart rate and a member function that calculates and returns the person’s target heart rate. Write a program that prompts for the person’s information, instantiates an object of class HeartRates and prints the information from that object—including the person’s first name, last name and date of birth—then calculates and prints the person’s age in (years), maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range.

| **Compilation**              | The program compiles without errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 20%    |
| **Classes and Constructor**  | Start by defining the class. In the constructor, take parameters for initializing the attributes.                                                                                                                                                                            | 15%    |
| **Setter and Getter Functions** | Setter functions for each attribute to set their values and Getter functions for each attribute to retrieve their values properly.                                                                                                                                          | 25%    |
| **Input/Output**             | Prompt the user to input the person's information (first name, last name, and date of birth) and then display the person's information along with the calculated age, maximum heart rate, and target heart rate range.                                                      | 15%    |
| **Calculation Methods**      | Create member functions to calculate the person's age, the person's maximum heart rate using the AHA formula, and to calculate the person's target heart rate range.                                                                                                         | 25%    |
